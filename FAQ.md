## F.A.Q

Q: What are the main differences between Moshidon and Megalodon?

A: There are many, but the most outstanding differences are: the ability to have other server's local timeline inside the app. It can be acessed in the "Add community" option in the top right corner of the Edit timelines screen. Other outstanding features that Moshidon has are some quality of life improvements, such as notification actions and allowing for unlisted replies by default.  Most other features are pretty minor, such as profile notes directly available in the person's profile. Other features are quite minor usability and visibility improvements. All of which can be found in the settings page. 

Q: Will there ever be a version of Moshidon for iOS? 

A: No. As android and iOS apps do not share code, it is incredibly hard to port.

Q. How do I install the github version?

A. [Download the latest stable or nightly release from Github](https://github.com/LucasGGamerM/moshidon/releases/) as an .apk file and open it. You might have to accept installing APK files from your browser. Moshidon will automatically check for new updates available on GitHub and offer to download and install them within the app. You can also manually press “Check for updates” at the bottom of the settings page.
